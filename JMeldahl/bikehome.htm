        	<h3>Our History</h3>
            	<p>Handy with a wrench and eager to help, Lyle Lee started out fixing bicycles for friends and family as a hobby over 50 years ago. After moving near the Root River Trail in Peterson, MN, Lyle was able to extend a helping hand to bicyclists and word soon spread about the "Bike Man" in Peterson. People come from miles around to have their bicycles fixed with care or to purchase a new bicycle that will last for years to come.
                </p>
                <p>As his business grew, his family joined in. Children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren help in all aspects of the company. Sons, Ardell, Steve, and Jeff, assist with bicycle repairs and maintenance. His daughter, Joanne, keeps daily operations running smoothly and heads the accounting department. Her husband, Keith, a retired Marine, acquires vintage or rare items. Grandson, Jeremy, manages the Information Technology and Communications departments; granddaughter, Jaime, is head of sales and purchasing; and granddaughter, Jessica, manages graphic and web design while her husband, David, perfects custom paint jobs. Great-grandchildren, Jordan and Kingston, keep everyone on their toes, greet customers, and provide plenty of laughter and fun!
